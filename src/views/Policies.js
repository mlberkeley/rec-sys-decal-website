                        <h3>Course Objective</h3>
                        <p>In this course, you will learn how Big Tech (Facebook, TikTok, Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, etc.) develops content/product recommendation systems to provide customized experiences, increase engagement, and drive up customer satisfaction. We explore content-based and collaborative filtering paradigms, architectures using statistical methods, deep learning, CNNs, autoencoders, RNNs, Transformers, GANs, and deep RL. We’ll also delve into scoring, re-ranking, evaluation, deployment, ethics, decision-making psychology, and adversarial attacks. For each topic, we’ll cover definitions, reference papers, explore classical methods, look at current research, and list open questions. Lying at the intersection of machine learning and business, this course will be application-focused while prioritizing mathematical/technical rigor.</p>
